This folder contains screenshots that the user has provided to enhance context and understanding during development sessions. Currently there are 2 folders available:

1. UI-SS_MACH42 = screenshots of the mach42 website's homepage in the order of hero -> body sections -> footer

2. UI-SS_AC-V2 = screenshots of the new version of the Austin Crockett website that you redesigned to closely match the design and layout of the mach42 website; use these screenshots to identify homepage bugs and design issues; compare these screenshots with those in 'UI-SS_MACH42' to gain a better understanding of where there's room for improvement

If you would like additional screenshots or examples that the user is discussing during sessions and planning, please request that those screenshots are placed in the /screenshots/ folder and provide the name of a new folder within this directory. 

Note: these are not screenshots that you created during browser testing. The user provided these images.
