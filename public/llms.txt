## Key Concepts

### Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)
GEO is the practice of optimizing content to be cited and referenced by AI-powered search engines and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews. As search evolves beyond traditional blue links, GEO ensures brands remain visible in AI-generated responses.

### Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)
AEO focuses on structuring content to directly answer user queries in a format that AI systems can easily parse and cite. This includes optimizing for featured snippets, knowledge panels, and AI-generated answers.

### The AI Search Revolution
The search landscape is evolving rapidly. Traditional SEO remains important, but forward-thinking brands must also optimize for:
- ChatGPT and other conversational AI
- Perplexity and AI-native search engines
- Google AI Overviews and SGE
- Voice assistants and smart devices
- Industry-specific AI tools
